    - I am versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MVC Pattern, Vue, Auth0, mongoDB and Postman
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about good books, deep philosophical questions, and the air-speed-velocity of an unladen swallow<!--and your mom!-->
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a bit of a nut when it comes to autumn and Halloween, and it is a lifelong dream of mine to buy an old decrepit house and turn it into a haunted attraction
